How to build
----

 - Make sure you have Visual Studio. If you don't, you can install the free [express edition](http://www.microsoft.com/express/Downloads/#2010-Visual-CS).
 - Set the environment variable %PDNPATH% to your Paint.NET directory (without the trailing \). e.g. `C:\Program Files\Paint.NET`.
